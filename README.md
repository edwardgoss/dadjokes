LIVE PREVIEW: https://edwardgoss.github.io/dadjokes/

Created a Frontend site that allows users to easily view, rank, and fetch dad jokes from a dad jokes API. Incorporated a voting system that ranks jokes based on upvotes and downvotes, and leveraged localStorage for recently viewed jokes so that jokes and rankings persist on the userâ€™s device.

Utilized: JavaScript | React | localStorage | icanhazdadjoke API | GitHub Pages
